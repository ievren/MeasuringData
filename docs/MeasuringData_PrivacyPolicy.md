# Privacy Policy

I, the developer of the MeasuringData application, hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect any personal data:** MeasuringData does not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive data from our users. This includes but is not limited to names, email addresses, phone numbers, and any other personal information.


## Explanation of Permissions Requested in the App

Below is a list of permissions required by the MeasuringData application and an explanation of why each permission is necessary.

| Permission                                   | Purpose                                                                                                                     |
|:--------------------------------------------:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `android.permission.BLUETOOTH`               | This permission is required for the app to function properly. The MeasuringData app utilizes Bluetooth Low Energy signals for its operation. |
| `android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN`         | This permission is necessary for the app to initiate device discovery, which is a core function of Bluetooth communication. |
| `android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`  | On devices running Android 9 and lower, the app uses this permission in place of `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` for the same reason as mentioned above. |
| `android.permission.INTERNET`               | This permission allows the app to fetch the latest data for measurements, ensuring accuracy and up-to-date information. |
